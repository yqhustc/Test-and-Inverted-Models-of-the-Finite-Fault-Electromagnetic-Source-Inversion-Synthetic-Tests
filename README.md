# Test-and-Inverted-Models-of-the-Finite-Fault-Electromagnetic-Source-Inversion-Synthetic-Tests
This data set includes the test model and inversion results shown in the article "Finite Fault Electromagnetic Source Inversion for Seismogenic Process".
The first column in the txt file is the strength coefficient, the second column is the excitation time difference, and the third column is the dipole's orientation angle.
‘single_plot.m’ and ‘multi_plot.m’ are the drawing scripts for Figures 3 and 4 in the paper.
